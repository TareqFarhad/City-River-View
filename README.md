# COMPUTER-GRAPHICS-PROJECT-City-River-View-Scenario.-
## Abstract
<p>This project is about the City River View Scenario animation. We are implementing it using different primitives available in computer graphics OpenGL 
library and combining them together in a required manner. This project consists of City River View Scenario animation is constructed by using different 
primitives available in OpenGL library. It illustrates the role of different callback functions that provides easier way to accomplish our project in an effective manner. 
The project has been implemented by efficiently using various functions and features that are available in the OpenGL.</p>

## Introduction
<p>Computers have become a powerful tool for the rapid and economical production of pictures. There is virtually no area in which graphical displays cannot be used to some
advantage, and so it is not surprising to find the use of computer graphics so widespread. Although early applications in engineering and science had to rely on expensive 
and cumbersome equipment, advances in computer technology have made interactive computer graphics a practical tool. Today, we find computer graphics used routinely in such diverse areas as science, engineering, medicine, business, industry, government, art, entertainment, advertising, education, and training.</p>

<p>Here we have used computer graphics OpenGL implement our mini project, city river view Scenario animation. By using it, we can create interactive applications which render high-quality city river view scenario. We uses different primitives in opengl like quads, circle, polygon, line to construct the city river view scenario. Those primitives are used to draw different objects and there are some functions which are also used for some animation which are also included in our projects.  We have created a city river scene of different view. There many view at different time and there are included some animation. We implement different objects in the scenario and some objects are in animated form like bus, boat, cloud which makes the project more realistic.</p>

## Objective
<p>Design and develop a city river view scenario on computer graphics.</p>

## Development of the application
<p>We use different resources to develop the project. These are:	
  <ul>
     <li>Visual Studio</li>
     <li>Computer</li>
      <li>OpenGl primitives</li>
  </ul>
</p>

## Projects Features
<p>We implemented auto animation process in our project by using timer functions which will show different views of city river. There are different view of city river scenario. We set time which will automatically moves from one view to another view and also used different objects in different view. The scenario contains many views those are day view, day rain view, night view, night rain view. We used different objects in day and night view. Some are missing in different view objects and some are animated, some are fixed. We used some functions that are already in the OpenGL. Those functions were used to create the objects, to make some objects animated configuration.</p>

## Different view
<p> Now the different view of our city river view scenario at different time are given below:</p>

## Impact
Computer graphics is the discipline of generating images with the aid of computers. Today, computer graphics is a core technology in digital photography, film, video games, cell phone and computer displays, and many specialized applications. A great deal of specialized hardware and software has been developed, with the displays of most devices being driven by computer graphics hardware. It is a vast and recently developed area of computer science. For creating the city river view scenario we use computer graphics instead of using normal graphics because the normal graphics is fixed image but in computer graphics images are not fixed. We can make animation, we can control the image which can’t be done in normal image. So computer graphics is more useful than normal graphics.

## Limitation
The limitation of our project is that our city river view scenario is 2D and we can’t make the projects more realistic because of time. We will work on that to improve that limitation to make the scenario more realistic and make the 2D scenario to 3D scenario.

## Conclusion
This project would be helpful for making many animations and mini projects. This types of project has lots of demand in animation market. It also bring a new generation of 2d animations.
